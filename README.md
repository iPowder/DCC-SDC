# DCC-SDC: An Independent Stress Analysis Software for Line-Beam Debye Rings

DCC-SDC is a standalone software system designed specifically for stress analysis of Debye rings generated by elongated slits in synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction experiments. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built with **PySide6**, while the core data processing is implemented in **Python**, following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern. Robust decoupling between the UI and business logic is achieved through the signal-slot mechanism, ensuring high maintainability and system stability.

The software includes example datasets (located in the `Example` folder). Below is the typical workflow (each step is accompanied by illustrative screenshots):

1. **Add a Standard Sample**  
   Click the **“Add Standard Sample”** button to load a calibration standard.

2. **Perform Geometric Calibration**  
   Select the standard material (currently supported: CeO₂, Si, LaB₆), input the X-ray wavelength and pixel size, then click **“Calibration”**.  
   The software will automatically complete calibration within a few seconds. A **blue calibration ring** appearing on the right side of the image indicates successful calibration.

3. **Load Experimental Samples**  
   Click **“Add Sample”** to import sample data (e.g., `S1` through `S6` from the example dataset). Click any file in the sample list to preview its corresponding Debye ring image.

4. **Select Diffraction Rings for Analysis**  
   Click the **“Select Ring”** button to enter ring selection mode. Simply click on a Debye ring in the image—the software will automatically detect and highlight it.  
   To reorder the analysis sequence, **drag and drop items** in the file list.

5. **Calculate Strain**  
   Click **“Calculate Strain”** and wait briefly to obtain the final strain analysis results.
